                The fire broke out just after 6:30 p.m. near 2nd Street and Myrtle. Roughly 40 firefighters and 13 crews
                responded to the scene. The building is currently under construction. Numerous roads in the area were
                closed while crews worked to contain the fire.<a class="continue"

            <p class="largeart"><img class="fireImg" src="/Lesson11/images/fire.jpg" alt=""> BOISE, Idaho (CBS2) — A
                second-alarm fire broke out at a nine-story building under construction in downtown Boise
                Thursday.<br><br>

                The fire broke out just after 6:30 p.m. near 2nd Street and Myrtle. Roughly 40 firefighters and 13 crews
                responded to the scene. The building is currently under construction. Numerous roads in the area were
                closed while crews worked to contain the fire.<br><br>


                Battalion Chief Steve Rasulo says the building had scaffolding in places inside the outer walls, which
                made for tough access for firefighters. Crews used their 100-foot ladder to help get water onto the
                flames.<br><br>

                "Access to the building was initially difficult as the building was under construction and one of the
                fire hydrants was not yet in service," Boise Fire said.
                The fire was under control by 7:08 p.m.<a class="continue"

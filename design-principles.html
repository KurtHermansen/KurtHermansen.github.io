            </div>
            <p class="desP">Microsoft’s home page is a great example of hick’s law in action. Even though Microsoft has many products
                to offer they do not overwhelm you with all they have to offer on the home page. The site had two
                carousel products with an image, brief reason why you would want the product, and a shop now button.
                They kept it extremely simple so that you are pulled into the site and not blinded by the options. </p>

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>Apple</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="blank">Apple.com</a></p>
            <div class="imgCenter">
                <img class="appleImg" src="/Images/Apple-OPT.jpg" alt="Apple Home Page">
            </div>
            <p class="desP">Apple has a very basic mobile viewport, and the text and color scheme is almost as simple as you can get. The contrast comes from the bright array of new iPhone 12’s. Your eyes can help being drawn to the stark contrast. Even the apple logo is not that pronounced. It is almost like they are saying, “You know what you are looking at just go ahead and buy it already.”</p>

            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <p>Coca-Cola</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/" target="blank">Coca-Cola.com</a></p>
            <div class="imgCenter">
                <img class="cocaImg" src="/Images/Coca-Cola-OPT.jpg" alt="Coca-Cola Home Page">
            </div>
            <p class="desP">Coca-Cola’s site said one thing to me repetition. You see all the logo’s facing the same direction almost dancing together. Then you look at the hands holding the drinks they are almost mirror images of one another, despite being different hands. This even goes down to the rings they are wearing. You can only see a little piece of the countries linked below but they keep that same repetition going well past what you can see.  </p>
